This was a module undertaken during my third year semester 1.

Assignment 1:
Hash tables, parsing and linked lists:
Involved parsing a CSV file stroing the data in an array using hash tables with seperate chaining.

Assignment 2:
Implementing and comparing various sorting Algorithms:
Selection sort, insertion sort and quick sort were all implemented and their performance compared.

Assignment 3:
Binary Search Trees:
Binary search trees were implemented in order to store a database of books with additional information which could easily be searched.

Assignment 4:
Graphs and pathfinding:
Implementation of DFS and BFS to search a graph.
Djikstras algorithm was implemented in order to find the shortest path between two bus stops in Ireland using a weighted graph.
